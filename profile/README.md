# Coach Net

The Coach Net is a startup project focused on lifestyle, health and well-being, which aims to solve problems and make life easier for people who already practice or want to exercise regularly.

The idea is to create a network and offer tools for integration and encouragement among people who want to make health care a philosophy of life.

I'm [Fabiano Couto](https://github.com/fabianocouto), I'm a developer, and the idea came when I started to identify my own pains and difficulties when trying to attend a gym and practice a sport.

If you are curious and want to know more about the project, for those who know how to join forces and get it off the ground by building an MVP, get in touch.

I need encouragement and look forward to a [contact](https://github.com/coachnet/about/issues).

Thanks in advance!
